# Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis Report

## 🎯 Objective
To identify phishing indicators from a suspicious email claiming to be from LastPass.

## 🔍 Analysis Summary

1. **Suspicious Sender Address**  
   - From: LastPass@secure-monitor.com  
   - Does not belong to the official LastPass domain.

2. **Urgent and Alarmist Language**  
   - The message creates panic by claiming a data breach involving passwords.

3. **Misleading Link**  
   - The link "this secure web site" is likely spoofed and not verified.

4. **Requests Sensitive Information**  
   - Asks users to input their login credentials via a third-party link.

5. **Spelling/Grammar Errors**  
   - Minor errors like the spacing in "web site" instead of "website".

6. **Lack of Personalization**  
   - Uses "Dear LastPass User" instead of addressing the user by name.

## 🧠 Conclusion
The email contains multiple phishing indicators and should not be trusted. Users must avoid clicking links or entering credentials from such sources.
